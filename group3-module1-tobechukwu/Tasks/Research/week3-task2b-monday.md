#### Fundamentals of UI/UX Design

#### Introduction

The terms UI and UX are often used interchangeably, but actually mean different things. UX design refers to the term “user experience design”, while UI stands for “user interface design”. Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together. But despite their professional relationship, the roles themselves are quite different, referring to very different aspects of the product development process and the design discipline.

#### What is User Interface Design?

User interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerized devices, focusing on looks or style. User Interface (UI) Design focuses on anticipating what users might need to do and ensuring that the interface has elements that are easy to access, understand, and use to facilitate those actions. UI brings together concepts from interaction design, visual design, and information architecture.
Interface elements include but are not limited to:

- Input Controls: buttons, text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown lists, list boxes, toggles, date field
- Navigational Components: breadcrumb, slider, search field, pagination, slider, tags, icons
- Informational Components: tooltips, icons, progress bar, notifications, message boxes, modal windows
- Containers: accordion

#### What is User Experience Design?

User experience design (UX) is a set of technologies which increase user satisfaction by improving usability and concepts related to interaction between human users and computers. User experience design is a human-first way of designing products. Don Norman, a cognitive scientist and co-founder of the Nielsen Norman Group Design Consultancy, is credited with coining the term “user experience” in the late 1990s. UX design is a broad sphere consisting of several components that are its constituents. UX design includes usability, human factors, accessibility and various kinds of design and system performance.

#### Difference between UI and UX

A UI designer is more likely to be responsible for the aesthetics of a product, while the UX designer is more concerned with how the overall experience feels. A popular analogy used to explain the relationship between UX and UI is that of a house: The UX of the house consists of the foundations, structure, and framing, while the UI components are things like the wallpaper, paint, and interior design.

#### Components of User Experience

##### Usability

Usability concentrates on people, their satisfaction and how they use and understand things. People change very slowly, while technology changes quickly. The concept is not just about technology and ease of use. Usability is a fundamental level of user experience. Without usability it is difficult to create a functional user experience. It is important, because if a product has bad usability, users are not able to achieve the aims in an efficient, effective and satisfied manner. They will leave the website and start to seek an alternative variant. A product with bad usability leads to bad user experience.

##### Visual Design

Visual design is focused on visual communication and aesthetic of a website. Visual design contains a set of basic elements: color theory, typography, hierarchy, correct placement of the objects and the other elements. Bringing them together in a right way allows creating a successful design. Well-developed visual design increases engaging of the users and helps to establish a trust and interest related to the product.

##### Human Factors

Human psychology plays one of the main roles in user experience design. A website can be created for the different kinds of use. The target audience deserves a well-implemented design for a web product. Well-known target audience is a web designer’s regular duty and a key to successful result of the project. Study of the human psychology gives the opportunity to understand how people make decisions, how people think, what makes a user to act or how to encourage people to realize the ideas and aims of a website. The answers to these questions aid to make a design better.

#### Best Practices for Designing an Interface

(1) **Keep the interface simple** : The best interfaces are almost invisible to the user. They avoid unnecessary elements and are clear in the language they use on labels and in messaging.

(2) **Create consistency and use common UI elements** : By using common elements in your UI, users feel more comfortable and are able to get things done more quickly. It is also important to create patterns in language, layout and design throughout the site to help facilitate efficiency. Once a user learns how to do something, they should be able to transfer that skill to other parts of the site.

(3) **Be purposeful in page layout** : Consider the spatial relationships between items on the page and structure the page based on importance. Careful placement of items can help draw attention to the most important pieces of information and can aid scanning and readability.

(4) **Strategically use color and texture** : You can direct attention toward or redirect attention away from items using color, light, contrast, and texture to your advantage.

(5) **Use typography to create hierarchy and clarity** : Carefully consider how you use typeface. Different sizes, fonts, and arrangement of the text to help increase scan ability, legibility and readability.

(6) **Make sure that the system communicates what is happening** : Always inform your users of location, actions, changes in state, or errors. The use of various UI elements to communicate status and, if necessary, next steps can reduce frustration for your user.

(7) **Think about the defaults** : By carefully thinking about and anticipating the goals people bring to your site, you can create defaults that reduce the burden on the user. This becomes particularly important when it comes to form design where you might have an opportunity to have some fields pre-chosen or filled out.
