### Scrum

Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. It is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.

Scrum implements the scientific method of empiricism. Scrum replaces a programmed algorithmic approach with a heuristic one, with respect for people and self-organization to deal with unpredictability and solving complex problems.

Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum. All events are time-boxed. Once a Sprint begins, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened. The remaining events may end whenever the purpose of the event is achieved, ensuring an appropriate amount of time is spent without allowing waste in the process. The Scrum Events are:

- Sprint
- Sprint Planning
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

###Benefits of scrum in software development?

1. Improvement of communication and coordination within the team: The Scrum methodology enhances communication in meetings where tasks that are going to part of the Sprint are analyzed and estimated. Also the daily, demo, and retrospective meetings facilitates the transfer of information and encourages collaboration between team members.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

2. Periodic Deliveries for continuous improvement: This allows for the possibility of adding functionalities to the product in an incremental way.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

3. Motivated teams for better results: Periodic deliveries allow the teams to see results in the short term. This transmits a sense of progress and encourages team work.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

4. Autonomy and Empowerment: The Scrum methodology gives freedom to each team member to perform tasks, as long as they feel able to develop them. This encourages team members to perform increasingly complex tasks, thus distributing knowledge knowing that, if necessary, there is another member who is able to perform a certain task.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

5. Product Quality: The Scrum methodology leads to the development of high-quality standard product for clients. This is because at the end of each iteration, areas to improve upon to deliver the best result are highlighted.
