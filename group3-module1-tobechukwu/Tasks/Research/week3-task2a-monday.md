#### Tutorial 1

UX stands for user experience. It is a term used to describe the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service in a given context.

##### Good vs bad UX design

A product with a good UX design will be: desirable, usable, useful. findable, accessible, and credible.

#### Tutorial 1 Practical

Google Chrome browser on mobile does not have a “click to go forward” and a “click to go back” button. To go back you will need to use the phone’s back button.

#### Tutorial 2

The UX design process can generally be divided into four key phases: research, design, testing, and implementation.

##### User Research

This all starts with the user. This allows a designer to understand how the user thinks and behaves. The designer receives a brief from the Head of Product to conduct initial research for a new product feature. Then a competitor research is carried out to see what’s out there, before moving on to interviews with actual prospective users. A survey and interview of any existing users, as well as product stakeholders, to identify their needs, pain-points, and any opportunities for improvement is also done.

##### User Personas and user flows

With meaningful insights from the research phase, the next step is to create a user persona. A user persona is a fictional but realistic representation of a set of target users based on their goals, need, and behaviors. After a persona has been created, it is then important to look at specific tasks that each persona might want to perform, and then create a flow depicting the path to achieve that goal.

##### Wireframes and prototypes

Once the steps in the user journey have been mapped out, a designer can start to define how the content on each page should be organized, as well as how these pages can fit together in a way that’s intuitive and easy for the user to navigate.

#### Tutorial 2 Practical

My final year project involved me iterating over which methodology is best to quickly meet my set objective. This is similar to how the user flow in the design process in which the UX designer creates a flow depicting the path to achieving a task carried out by a persona.

#### Tutorial 3

##### Four Quadrants

- Experience Strategy (ExS)
- User Research (UR)
- Information Architecture (IA)
- Interaction Design (IxD)

#### Tutorial 3 Practical

Yael Levey: Experience Strategy. This is because he is a product design manager.
Jared Spool: User Research, Interaction Design. This is inferred from his profile on his website.

#### Tutorial 4 Practical

How would you explain to a nonprofessional what UX design is and what your role entails?

UX is about the process of design and how you channel your users’ needs—it’s more than just a beautiful end product. In fact, the final, visual stage of the design process is often completed by a user interface designer.

I work with a great many documents and design deliverables—from design briefs, research findings, and interview results, to wireframes, prototypes, and design specifications.
